Video
=====
The 15 KHz and 31 KHz modes are intended for analog video only. The pixel
clock rates were multiplied up (8x and 4x respectively) in order to meet the
requirements of the DAC, and to simplify the FPGA logic. If you happen to have
a higher end flat panel monitor, then you may be able to display the 31 KHz
mode over DVI-D, but the aspect ratio will be completely wrong because of the
higher pixel rate. In this case, you may be able to adjust the monitor scaling
in order to get the correct ratio.

The 640x480 mode is intended for use with DVI-D flat panel monitors. It will
display fine on just about any flat panel on the market, but the video data is
simply scan doubled up to 480x384 inside a 640x480 display, so it won't fill
the entire screen. If the monitor has a zoom feature then you should be able to
fill the screen. 

When the analog sync is set to composite, the composite sync signal is output
on the analog H sync pin of the DVI connector.
