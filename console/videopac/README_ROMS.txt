Due to copyright reasons, ROMs are not included
and must be placed separately on the Replay SDCARD.

Get the BIOS ROM content from a Videopac/Odyssey2 console and name it o2rom.bin
Place the cartridge ROM files next to the BIOS ROM. You can optionally
organize them in a subfolder.

Cartridges are "inserted" via the OSD menu.
