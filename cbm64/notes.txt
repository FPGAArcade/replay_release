CBM64 Kernal
===========
I've included my customized kernal which has a built-in wedge. The cbm64_xxx.ini files
load this kernal by default. If you wish to temporarily fall back to the standard kernal
you can use the "Load Kernal" menu item to load it in place of the custom kernal. Edit
the file if you wish to use the standard kernal by default.

Wedge commands
--------------
$  - list directory
/  - load BASIC program at $0801
%  - load ML program at address specified in the file
>  - display hex dump of file
<- - save BASIC program
#  - change current device number (value in memory location $ba)
@  - issue DOS command, or read error channel if not followed by an argument


CBM1541
========
The CBM1541 drive emulation currently only supports D64 files. It will handle both 35 and
40 track images, and uses the D64 error information to generate read errors if the file
contains an error block.

This drive emulation does have a few limitations. It doesn't support a full format via
the N:DISKNAME,ID command. It will however handle a short format (N:DISKNAME) just fine.
The error block, if it exists, is read-only. There's no way to create disk errors on the
image file by using a disk tool on the C64.


Epyx Fastload Cartridge
=======================
The Epyx Fastload cartridge requires special handling, and can't be loaded into ROM space
from the menu. The 8K fastload cartridge data must be available in ROM space at both $8000
and $c000, and since the Replay menu doesn't provide the ability to load a cartridge into
two different memory areas in the same operation, the only way to load it correctly is
from the .ini file. To activate fastload, in case it is disabled, change the cartridge
type to Epyx Fastload from the menu, and then reset.


Dual SID
========
The address of the second SID is $D420.


Keyboard
========
The key mapping in the FPGA has been designed for a standard 104 key keyboard. This mapping
emulates the positions of the keys on a C-64 keyboard. The keys that differ from what's
printed on the PS/2 keycap are as follows.

PS/2		C-64
