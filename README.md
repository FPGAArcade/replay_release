# replay_release

This repository contains firmware releases along with releases for cores 
still built with the legacy build system.

Stable releases of cores that have been migrated to the new build system
can be found at [build.fpgaarcade.com/releases/](https://build.fpgaarcade.com/releases/)

In addition, if you're feeling adventurous, per commit builds of cores are
available via the [build server](https://build.fpgaarcade.com/).
